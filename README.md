# Getting Started!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Note: We used Visual Studios as our IDE.

## 1 - Start the server.

In the project directory, cd into server. Then you can run:

### `python3 server.py`

## 2 - Start the program.

With the server running, open a new terminal. In the project directory, run:

### `npm run start`
